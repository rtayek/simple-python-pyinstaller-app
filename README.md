# simple-python-pyinstaller-app

This a fork of [Build a Python app with PyInstaller](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-python-app-with-pyinstaller/) tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

Moved the jenkins file to top level so jenkins would find something.
Added a docker file and some notes.
Made folders for jenkins-data/  jenkins-docker-certs/  jenkins-home/ 
Made a shell script (run.sh) to build and run.
